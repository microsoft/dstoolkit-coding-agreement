# Project

A coding agreement is a guideline validated by all the participants at the beginning of a project that defines what we expect in the code: how to name variables, functions, how exceptions should be managed, etc. This is not intended to replace official guidelines for a technology, but more to define how these guidelines apply to the current project. A coding agreement is meant to be more flexible than a style guide and can even go beyond it, for example, by defining which testing framework will be used, or providing templates for common but complex design patterns, such as dependency injection. Having the coding agreement read, understood, and validated by all (e.g., through a Pull Request review) will ensure that everyone will be on board with it.

This repo provides a baseline coding agreement for Python that can be extended for the needs of a specific project. 

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions, for example coding agreements for languages other than Python or coding agreement for specific use cases.

Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,
